                            This project comes from Creative Coding Practices and Techniques. 
                            Great professor, and wonderful material. A lot of the class was learning different methods to accomplish relatively
                             simple things, then being unleashed to do anything we were inspired to do.
                            <br><br>
                            As my professor said, sometimes the bugs in a program create the most interesting outcome.

                            This program was supposed to make a circle rotate and change colors, but instead it looped in on itself,
                            making a tunnel of overlapping squares, looking like stained glass. Unintended, but quite cool to watch run.

                            Right before I switched to Computer Science, I took Graphics and Design with another great professor.
                            The class focused on how to approach designing solutions for a problem, and then how to use the software that 
                            can solve it.
                            <br><br>
                            We used SolidWorks, a 3D Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) tool. Our final project tasked us with taking a complex object (4+ distinct parts)
                            and recreating it in SolidWorks. Digital calipers were a godsend for this assignment.
                            <br><br>
                            I disassembled a non-functional headlamp I had in a closet and eventually recreated it in SolidWorks. My final report is pictured.

                            This is another project for Creative Coding and Practices and Techniques, the same class as Project 1.
                            <br><br>
                            For our final project, we had to make a project that was creative, and used a bunch of coding practices we covered during the semester.
                            Essentially, I created a bunch of rectangles that go left to right, rebounding when they hit the edges.
                            <br><br>
                            The rectangle speed is determined by height: the ones at the top are super fast, and the bottom are super slow, with 
                            gradual progression in-between.
                            <br><br>
                            This all combines with the hardest part of my project (because the other stuff isn't too tough): 
                            getting the timing down. Making correct ratios and speeds has the effect
                            of a repeating pattern; the rectangles will form intricate shapes and arrays for a few seconds before dissipating.
                            <br><br>
                            There is a massive amount of math devoted to the idea here, and it is generally applied to music.
